# DiCE â€“ Distributed Cache in Elixir

This will be (haven't written anything yet) a more or less faithful port of Andrey Paramonov's [blog post](http://ndpar.blogspot.sg/2010/01/distributed-cache-in-erlang.html) on Distributed cache in Erlang to Elixir.

The main motivation is to learn Mnesia and getting to grips with distribution in Elixir.

This might eventually evolve into a [book](http://www.exotpbook.com) chapter/section on Distribution.
